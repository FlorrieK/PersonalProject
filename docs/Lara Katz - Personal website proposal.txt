Lara Katz
Personal Website Proposal
3/31/20


        I would like to recreate my art selling website from Front-End Development. I intend to have a home page, a "Cart" page for the artworks selected for purchase, an "About the Artist" page, an "About the Web Designer" page (the latter two of which would be under the same tab "About" and accessible through a drop-down menu),and a "Checkout" page, in addition to gallery pages. I recall that the artworks could be roughly broken up by size, and so I intend to have a "Gallery" tab with a dropdown menu for "Large," "Medium," and "Small." When the user clicks on one of these pages, they will be able to access an online gallery of all of the artwork in that size range. When the user clicks on a given artwork, they will be brought to a page just for that piece of art, which will contain a large picture of the artwork and details about the work—dimensions, year completed, method of creation (i.e. oil, watercolor, etc.), and price. On this page the user will be able to click "Add to Cart." Once the artwork has been added to the cart, the "Cart" page (accessible in the upper righthand corner via a small shopping cart symbol) will contain the potential purchase and have a "total price" listed at the bottom of the page that adds up the costs of the artworks in the cart and includes tax. Once the user clicks the "Checkout" button, they will be brought to the "Checkout" page where they will be prompted to input their name, email, mailing address, and credit card information. The shipping will be calculated based on the mailing address, and then the user will receive a confirmation email that contains a button that navigates them back to the "Checkout" page so they can review their purchase history. The artwork will be mailed to the user at this time.
